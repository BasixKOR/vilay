**Vilay** is a web app framework that:

- ✅ **is built on Vite and vite-plugin-ssr**
- ✅ **supports React 18 SSR streaming by default**
- ✅ **is GraphQL-centric, bu providing deep integrations with Relay (Render-as-you-fetch support)**
- ✅ **is easy and convenient to use**

It is currently being actively developed to be used in production applications, which means that the framework keeps evolving.
While a lot of exciting features will be added over time, expect breaking changes between versions!
